# AI-ChatBot
AI ChatBot made using Python

An interactive tool designed to handle customer queries, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis. Built using Python, the chatbot integrates frameworks like TensorFlow for intent recognition and NLTK for tokenization and sentiment analysis. It processes user inputs, classifies them into predefined intents using a trained neural network model, and responds with relevant, context-aware replies. 

The chatbotâ€™s responses are enhanced by analyzing user sentiment to adapt communication tone. Developed as a Flask-based API, the chatbot enables seamless interaction and testing through both Postman and Python scripts. By combining machine learning, NLP techniques, and RESTful API integration, this project demonstrates a robust implementation of conversational AI for practical use in customer support systems.
