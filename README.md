# AI-ChatBot
Work-in-progress AI ChatBot made using Python, SymPy, and JSON. This chatbot can be used to solve and learn algebra (thus far), with future goals of being able to compute calculus and physics problems. The AI chatbot can solve equations and provide explanations/definitions of algebraic terms.
